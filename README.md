# Tech Used

For this project, I used HTML, CSS and JS.

# How it Works

This is a simple application to use. Add a the name of the expense and add the amount. If you are adding an expense, add a "-" before the amount, to let the app know that his was an expense. Once you add the information and submit it, the app will show the transaction to the history and will update the total. Also, the application saves the information to your local storage so you don't lose the information.
